#SoSafe Home Security System

#Objective
The objective of the project is to install security system in a large commercial building to monitor one or more areas in the building. A commercial building can be divided into sections, where each section is divided into rooms. The system uses appropriate sensors, located at specific locations throughout the buildings to detect a break-in and set off an alarm/call a monitoring service through a phone-line to attend to the fire/ break-in event. 

#Features
● Configured the system to enable the customer to select the areas for security or fire alarm sensors.<br/>
● Configured the system to enable the customer set a schedule.<br/>
● Created a billing system for the customer.

#Demo 
For demo purposes, simulated a break-in or a fire.
<br/>
Once the customer configures and activates the security-system, the system continuously monitors for any break-ins or fire threats. Once the fire/break-in has been triggerred, the alarm goes off and indicates the monitoring service via a phone call. The monitoring service punches the rescue code and attends to the fire/break-in event.
